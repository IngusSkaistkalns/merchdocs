Your Magento account contains information that can be useful to trusted employees and service providers who help manage your site. As the primary account holder, you have authority to grant limited access to other Magento account holders. When your account is shared, all sensitive information &#8212; such as your billing history or credit card information &#8212; remains protected. It is not shared at any time with other users.
