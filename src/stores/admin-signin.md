The Magento Admin is protected by multiple layers of security measures to prevent unauthorized access to your store, order, and customer data. The first time you sign in to the Admin, you are required to enter your username and password, and also set up [two-factor authentication]({% link stores/security-two-factor-authentication.md %}) (2FA).

Depending on the configuration of your store, you might also be required to resolve a [CAPTCHA]({% link stores/security-google-recaptcha.md %}) challenge such as entering a series of keyboard characters, solving a puzzle, or clicking a series of images with a common theme. These tests are designed to identify you has human, rather than am automated bot.

For additional security, you can determine which parts of the Admin each user has [permission]({% link system/permissions.md %}) to access, and limit the number of [login attempts]({% link configuration/advanced/admin.md %}). By default, after six attempts the account is locked and the user must wait a few minutes before trying again. A [locked account]({% link system/permissions-locked-users.md %}) can also be reset from the Admin.

## Step 1: Set up two-factor authentication

Before you can sign in to the Admin of your store, you must have a two-factor authentication system set up and ready to use.

1. Complete the setup of your 2FA solution according to the provider's instructions.

## Step 2: Sign in to the Admin

1. Enter the Admin URL that was specified during the Magento installation.

   The default Admin URL looks something like `https://www.yourdomain.com/your-custom-admin-domain`.

   {: .bs-callout-info}
   Although we use "admin" as the base URL in most examples, we recommend that you choose a unique and hard to guess [custom URL]({%stores/store-urls-custom-admin %}) for the Admin of your store.

   You can bookmark the page or save a shortcut on your desktop for easy access.

1. Enter your Admin **Username** and **Password**.

1. Click **Sign in**.

   If this is the first time you have signed in to the Admin from this account, you will receive an email with a link to configuration instructions.
